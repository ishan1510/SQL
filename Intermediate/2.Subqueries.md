# SQL SUBQUERIES

## Introduction
A subquery is a query inside another query. Think of it as asking a question to help answer a bigger question. Subqueries help break down complex problems into smaller, easier-to-solve steps. They are used to filter results, calculate totals, or compare data.

## Types of Subqueries

### 1. Single-Row Subqueries
These return only **one value** and are used with comparison operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `<>`.

Example: Find employees who earn more than the average salary.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here, the subquery `(SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees)` calculates the average salary, and the main query finds employees earning more than that amount.

---

### 2. Multi-Row Subqueries
These return **multiple values** and work with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, and `ALL`.

#### Using `IN`
Find employees who work in departments located in New York.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'New York');
```

ðŸ‘‰ The subquery finds department IDs in New York, and the main query selects employees who work in those departments.

#### Using `ANY`
Find employees whose salary is higher than at least one analystâ€™s salary.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > ANY (SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE JobTitle = 'Analyst');
```

ðŸ‘‰ `ANY` means **at least one match**. This query finds employees earning more than at least one analyst.

#### Using `ALL`
Find employees who earn more than all interns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > ALL (SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE JobTitle = 'Intern');
```

ðŸ‘‰ `ALL` means **every match**. This query finds employees who earn more than every intern.

---

### 3. Correlated Subqueries
These depend on the outer query and run **once for each row** in the main query.

Example: Find employees who earn more than the average salary in their department.

```sql
SELECT E1.*
FROM Employees E1
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees E2 WHERE E1.DepartmentID = E2.DepartmentID);
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here, for each employee, the subquery calculates the average salary of their department and compares it with their salary.

---

### 4. Nested Subqueries
These are subqueries inside another subquery, like a question inside another question.

Example: Find employees who work in the department managed by 'John Doe'.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = (
    SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments
    WHERE ManagerID = (SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employees WHERE Name = 'John Doe')
);
```

ðŸ‘‰ The innermost query finds John Doeâ€™s employee ID, the middle query finds the department he manages, and the outer query finds employees in that department.

## When to Use Subqueries?
- When you need to **filter results based on calculations** (like average salary).
- When you need to **find data that depends on other data** (like employees working in a certain location).
- When a **JOIN is too complex** or not possible.
- When you need to **compare values within the same table** (like finding employees with the highest salary in each department).

## Conclusion
Subqueries help us answer complicated questions in a simple way by breaking them into smaller parts. They make SQL queries easier to read and understand. Mastering subqueries will help you retrieve and analyze data efficiently! ðŸš€
