# SQL WINDOW FUNCTIONS

## Introduction
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, **without collapsing rows into a single result** like aggregate functions. They help in ranking, running totals, and performing calculations within specific groups of data.

The `PARTITION BY` clause is used within window functions to divide the data into groups, so calculations apply separately to each group.

## Common Window Functions

### 1. ROW_NUMBER()
Assigns a unique row number to each row based on the specified order.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ This assigns a row number within each department, ordered by salary (highest first).

---

### 2. RANK()
Assigns a rank to each row, **but gives the same rank to duplicate values** and skips the next rank.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ If two employees have the same salary, they get the same rank, and the next rank is skipped (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).

---

### 3. DENSE_RANK()
Similar to `RANK()`, but **does not skip numbers** when duplicates exist.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ If two employees have the same salary, they get the same rank, but the next rank is not skipped (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3).

---

### 4. NTILE(n)
Divides the dataset into `n` equal parts and assigns a group number.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Quartile
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ This splits employees within each department into **4 groups (quartiles)** based on salary.

---

### 5. LAG() and LEAD()
Retrieve previous (`LAG`) or next (`LEAD`) row values without using self-joins.

#### LAG(): Get the previous row's value
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       LAG(Salary, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS PrevSalary
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Retrieves the salary of the **previous employee** in the department.

#### LEAD(): Get the next row's value
```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       LEAD(Salary, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS NextSalary
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ Retrieves the salary of the **next employee** in the department.

---

### 6. SUM() with PARTITION BY (Running Total)
Calculates the running total of salaries within each department.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ This adds up salaries **from the highest to the current row** in each department.

---

### 7. AVG() with PARTITION BY
Finds the average salary within each department, **but repeats the result for each row**.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Department, Salary,
       AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees;
```

ðŸ‘‰ This shows the **average salary per department** alongside each employeeâ€™s salary.

---

## Conclusion
Window functions allow you to perform calculations across sets of rows while keeping all rows in the output. They are incredibly useful for analytical queries and reporting. ðŸš€
