# SQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs make queries **more readable**, **easier to maintain**, and allow **recursive queries**.

Syntax -
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    -- Your Query Here
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM some_table
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```

### Why Use CTEs?
âœ… Improves readability and structure. <br><br>
âœ… Helps break down complex queries. <br><br>
âœ… Allows recursive queries. <br><br>
âœ… Can be referenced multiple times in a query. <br><br>

### Using a CTE
Example : Find employees with salaries above the department average.

```sql
WITH DeptAvg AS (
    SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department
)
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.Salary, e.Department
FROM Employees e
JOIN DeptAvg d ON e.Department = d.Department
WHERE e.Salary > d.AvgSalary;
```

ðŸ‘‰ The CTE (`DeptAvg`) calculates the average salary per department, and the main query retrieves employees earning above the average.

### Recursive CTEs
Recursive CTEs allow queries that **reference themselves**, useful for hierarchical data like employee-manager relationships.

Example: Recursive CTE for Employee Hierarchy
```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, Name, ManagerID, 1 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL  -- Start with top-level manager
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name, e.ManagerID, eh.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```

ðŸ‘‰ This finds all employees and their reporting hierarchy levels.

### When to Use CTEs?
- **Complex Queries**: Breaking large queries into smaller parts.
- **Recursive Queries**: Handling hierarchical data (e.g., employee-manager relationships, folder structures).
- **Multiple References**: When using the same subquery multiple times.
- **Improved Readability**: Making SQL queries easier to understand and maintain.

### Conclusion
CTEs are a powerful SQL feature that enhances query organization, improves maintainability, and enables recursive operations. ðŸš€
