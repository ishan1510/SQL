# SQL JOINS

## Introduction
SQL JOINS are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column. Understanding joins is essential for retrieving meaningful data from relational databases.

## Types of JOINS

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns only the matching rows from both tables.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.* 
FROM TableA A
INNER JOIN TableB B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for right table columns.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.* 
FROM TableA A
LEFT JOIN TableB B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```
---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL is returned for left table columns.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.* 
FROM TableA A
RIGHT JOIN TableB B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```

### 4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows when there is a match in either table. If there is no match, NULLs are returned for the missing side.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.* 
FROM TableA A
FULL JOIN TableB B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```
---

### 5. CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, meaning every row from the first table joins with every row from the second table.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.* 
FROM TableA A
CROSS JOIN TableB B;
```
---

### 6. SELF JOIN
A join where a table is joined with itself to compare rows within the same table.

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.* 
FROM TableA A
INNER JOIN TableA B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```

---

### 7. LEFT ANTI JOIN
Returns rows from the left table that do not have a match in the right table.

```sql
SELECT A.* 
FROM TableA A
LEFT JOIN TableB B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column
WHERE B.common_column IS NULL;
```
---

### 8. RIGHT ANTI JOIN
Returns rows from the right table that do not have a match in the left table.

```sql
SELECT B.* 
FROM TableA A
RIGHT JOIN TableB B 
ON A.common_column = B.common_column
WHERE A.common_column IS NULL;
```
---

### When to Use Which JOIN?
- Use **INNER JOIN** when you only need matching records.
- Use **LEFT JOIN** when you need all records from the left table, even if there's no match.
- Use **RIGHT JOIN** when you need all records from the right table.
- Use **FULL JOIN** when you need all records from both tables.
- Use **CROSS JOIN** when you need all possible combinations of records.
- Use **SELF JOIN** to compare rows within the same table.
- Use **LEFT ANTI JOIN** when you need records from the left table that have no match in the right table.
- Use **RIGHT ANTI JOIN** when you need records from the right table that have no match in the left table.

### Conclusion
JOINS are fundamental to SQL querying and enable effective data retrieval across multiple tables. Mastering them is crucial for working with relational databases efficiently.
