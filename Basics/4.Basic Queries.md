# 📘 Basic SQL Queries  

This section covers essential SQL queries like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, `LIMIT (TOP)`, and more.

### 1️. Retrieving Data: `SELECT`  
The `SELECT` statement is used to fetch data from a table.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
👉 Retrieves all columns from the employees table.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;
```
👉 Retrieves only first_name, last_name, and salary from employees.

### 2. Filtering Data: WHERE
Use WHERE to filter records based on conditions.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees  
WHERE salary > 50000;
```
👉 Retrieves employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees  
WHERE department = 'IT' AND is_active = 1;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees  
WHERE department = 'IT' OR designation = 'Manager';
```
👉 Retrieves all employees from the IT department and all employees who are Manager's, irrespective of their department.

### 3. Sorting Data: ORDER BY
The ORDER BY clause sorts query results.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees

```
👉 Sorts employees by salary in ascending order.

### 4. Select unique values: DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

## 5. Limiting Results: TOP
Use TOP to limit the number of rows returned.
```sql
SELECT TOP 5 * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
👉 Retrieves the top 5 highest-paid employees.

### 6. Pattern Matching: LIKE
The LIKE operator is used for pattern matching in text columns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```
👉 Finds employees with Gmail addresses.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE '_a%';
```
👉 Finds all customers that have "a" in the second position:.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE '%[ae]%';
```

| `%`      | Matches any number of characters (including none) |

### 8. Using BETWEEN for Range Queries
