# DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP Operation in SQL

## Delete
The **DELETE** statement is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

🔹 **If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all rows will be deleted!**

---

#### 1. Deleting Specific Rows

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```
👉 This deletes only the row where `EmployeeID` is 101.

---

#### 2. DELETE with JOIN

You can delete records based on a condition from another table using **JOIN**.

```sql
DELETE e
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE d.DepartmentName = 'HR';
```
👉 This removes employees belonging to the **HR department**.

---

#### 3. DELETE All Rows (Without Dropping Table)

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees;
```
👉 This removes **all records** but keeps the table structure **intact**.

---

### TRUNCATE: Remove All Data Faster
🔹 **TRUNCATE** removes all rows efficiently and resets identity columns.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
```
👉 **Faster than DELETE** because it doesn't log each row deletion.

#### Why is TRUNCATE Better Than DELETE When Removing All Rows?
1. **Performance** – TRUNCATE is much **faster** than DELETE because it doesn’t generate row-by-row delete logs.
2. **Resets Identity Columns** – If a table has an **auto-incremented primary key**, TRUNCATE **resets it to the seed value**.
3. **Less Log Overhead** – DELETE generates logs for every row removed, while TRUNCATE only logs **deallocation of data pages**.
4. **Locking Behavior** – DELETE locks each row individually, while TRUNCATE **locks the table and page-level resources**, improving efficiency.

🔹 **Use TRUNCATE when you want to remove all rows quickly without transaction log overhead!**

---

### DROP: Completely Remove Table
🔹 **DROP** deletes the table **structure and data permanently**.

```sql
DROP TABLE Employees;
```
👉 The table is **gone forever** unless restored from a backup.

### TRUNCATE vs DELETE vs DROP

| Operation  | Removes Data | Keeps Table Structure? | Can Use WHERE? | Auto-Increment Reset? | Rollback Possible? |
|------------|------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **DELETE** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (if inside a transaction) |
| **TRUNCATE** | ✅ Yes (all rows) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **DROP** | ✅ Yes (entire table) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ Not Applicable | ❌ No |

---

## When to Use What?
| Scenario | Best Option |
|----------|------------|
| Remove specific rows | **DELETE** |
| Remove all data but keep table | **TRUNCATE** |
| Completely remove table | **DROP** |

---

## Conclusion
Understanding `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP` helps maintain data integrity while efficiently managing tables in SQL. 🚀
