# 📘 Aggregation Functions in SQL  

Aggregation functions in SQL allow you to perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value. These functions are commonly used for reporting and analytics.

- `COUNT()` – Counts the number of rows  
- `SUM()` – Adds up values in a column  
- `AVG()` – Calculates the average value  
- `MAX()` – Returns the highest value  
- `MIN()` – Returns the lowest value  

These functions are often used with `GROUP BY` to summarize data.  

## 1️. Counting Rows: `COUNT()`  
The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows in a result set.  

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
```
👉 Counts all rows in the employees table. <br>


```sql
SELECT COUNT(department) AS total_departments FROM employees WHERE is_active = 1;
```
👉 Counts employees who belong to a department and are active. <br><br><br>

## 2. Summing Values: SUM()
The SUM() function calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;
```
👉 Calculates the total salary of all employees. <br>

```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department;
```
👉 Calculates the total salary for each department. <br><br><br>


## 3. Calculating Averages: AVG()
The AVG() function calculates the average (mean) value.
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
```
👉 Finds the average salary of all employees. <br>

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department;
```
👉 Finds the average salary for each department. <br><br><br>


## 4. Finding Maximum & Minimum Values: MAX() & MIN()
The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column.
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary, MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary FROM employees;
```
👉 Finds the highest and lowest salaries in the company. <br>

```sql
SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS max_salary, MIN(salary) AS min_salary  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department;
```
👉 Finds the highest and lowest salaries per department. <br><br><br>


## 5. Grouping Data: GROUP BY
The GROUP BY clause is used with aggregate functions to group data into categories.
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department;
```
👉 Counts the number of employees in each department. <br>

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS total_salary  
FROM employees  
WHERE is_active = 1  
GROUP BY department  
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```
👉 Filters groups where average salary exceeds 50,000 (using HAVING). <br><br>

🔹 Difference Between WHERE and HAVING in Aggregations:
## Difference Between `WHERE` and `HAVING` in Aggregations

| Clause  | When to Use | Works With | Example |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| `WHERE`  | Used to filter **individual rows** before aggregation | Any column in the table | `WHERE salary > 50000` |
| `HAVING` | Used to filter **grouped results** after aggregation | Aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc.) | `HAVING SUM(salary) > 500000` |

🔹 **Key Rule:** Use `WHERE` before `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` after `GROUP BY`. <br><br><br>

## 6. Using GROUP BY with Multiple Columns
You can GROUP BY multiple columns to get more granular results.
```sql
SELECT department, job_title, COUNT(*) AS employee_count  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department, job_title;
```
👉 Counts employees for each job_title within each department.
